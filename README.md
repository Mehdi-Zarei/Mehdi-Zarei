I am a highly motivated and results-oriented junior back-end web developer with a passion for creating intuitive and user-friendly web interfaces. I have proficiency in `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `TypeScript`, and have a basic understanding of `Linux`. I believe that bugs are opportunities to learn and grow. I am capable of understanding challenges and solving problems in this field. With my skills and experience, learning new technologies will not be difficult for me. I also have a strong team spirit and am able to work effectively and reliably in group projects.
